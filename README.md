# darkcloud-vimconfig #

A theme, config and collection of plugins for Vim.

## Requirements ##

* **Vim**: The latest [vim](http://www.vim.org) should be installed to use this distribution (versions 7.3 and below aren't tested or guaranteed to work).
* **Bash**: Required by the _update_ and _gentags_ scripts.
* **Git**: Required by the _update_ script and git-related plugins.
* **Python**: Required by the _gundo_ and _MatchTagAlways_ plugins.

## Optional Requirements ##

* **Artistic Style**: Required by the _autoformat_ plugin to format C, C++, C++/CLI, C#, and Java source ([astyle website](http://astyle.sourceforge.net)).
* **autopep8**: Required by the _autoformat_ plugin to format Python using the PEP 8 style guide ([autopep8 repo](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8)).
* **Compilers and Runtimes**: The syntastic plugin can use the compiler or runtime for most languages to provide real-time syntax checking.
* **CTags**: Required by the _tagbar_ and _neocomplcache_ plugins as well as the _gentags_ script ([ctags website](http://ctags.sourceforge.net)).
* **JS Beautifier**: Required by the _autoformat_ plugin to format Javascript source and HTML ([js-beautify repo](https://github.com/Chiel92/vim-autoformat)).
* **Powerline Fonts**: Required to enable the fancier looking status line ([powerline-fonts repo](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts)).
* **Tidy**: Required by the _autoformat_ plugin to format XHTML and XML ([tidy website](http://tidy.sourceforge.net)).

## Distribution Features ##

* **Default Configuration**: A complete set of defaults, focusing on the most modern settings that still provide a compatible experience.
* **Custom theme**: An original colour scheme with explicit values set to optimize the look of individual filetypes.
* **Key Bindings/Aliases**: A set of bindings and aliases defined to group similar features and provide numerous (and sometimes more familiar) ways to access options.
* **Plugins**: A set of plugins have been included and configured to provide support for most normally-unsupported filetypes, and a set of features useful when using Vim as an editor.
* **Custom Configuration**: A second vimrc and bundle folder are included that aren't maintained as part of the repo, making custom plugins and configuration easy to add.

## Installation ##

1. Clone the darkcloud-vimconfig repo and use the _update_ script to install the plugins:
  * `git clone https://github.com/prurigro/darkcloud-vimconfig.git`
  * `./darkcloud-vimconfig/update` (if you don't want colour output, run: `./darkcloud-vimconfig/update --no-colour` instead)
  * **Note**: The _update_ script requires bash, but if it's not available you can enter the _darkcloud-vimconfig/_ folder and run: `git submodule update --init` to install the plugins manually, then create _vim/vimrc.user_ and remember to run: `:Helptags` once everything else is running.
2. If you don't know where vim expects to find your vimrc, start vim and run: `:version` to find the values "user vimrc file" (for a single-user install) and "system vimrc file" (for a system-wide install). T
3. Copy or symlink the vimrc file from `darkcloud-vimconfig/vimrc` to one of the locations vim expects to find it, based on whether you want a local or system-wide install, then choose one of the following:
  * Edit the _g:darkcloudpath_ variable in the vimrc file itself, pointing it to the location you're keeping the _darkcloud-vimconfig_ repo folder.
  * Create a file @ _~/.vim/darkcloud-path.vim_ and in it put the following: `let g:darkcloudpath="/etc/darkcloud-vimconfig"`, but replacing _"/etc/darkcloud-vimconfig"_ with the path to the _darkcloud-vimconfig_ repo folder.
  * Place _darkcloud-vimconfig_ in the default location @ _/etc/darkcloud-vimconfig_.
  * Create your own vimrc and have that set the _g:darkcloudpath_ variable before sourcing the included vimrc.

### Vimpager ###

Once darkcloud-vimconfig has been set up, you can configure `vimpager` to use it by running (assuming the default path @ _"/etc/darkcloud-vimconfig"_):

`ln -s /etc/darkcloud-vimconfig/vimpagerrc /etc/vimpagerrc` (for a system-wide configuration), or:

`ln -s /etc/darkcloud-vimconfig/vimpagerrc ~/.vimpagerrc` (for a given user).

As usual, to have your system use `vimpager` in place of `less`, you'll need to set the **$PAGER** environment variable to `vimpager`:

`export PAGER=vimpager`, and configure aliases for less in _"/etc/bash.bashrc"_ or _"~/.bashrc"_: `alias less='vimpager'`

## Configuration ##

* **Configure Variables**: The following variables can be added to _vim/vimrc.user_ and have their values set to the values you require:
  * `g:autostartfiler`: **1** = Start the filer file manager when vim is run and the buffer is empty | **0** = Do nothing when vim is run and the buffer is empty (_default_: **1**)
  * `g:autostartchecker`: **1** = Check syntax once an appropriate file is loaded | **0** = Check syntax only after syntax checking is toggled on (_default_: **0**)
  * `g:autostarttagbar`: **1** = Have the tagbar load automatically when a compatible format is run | **0** = The tagbar will stay hidden until triggered on demand with its toggle (_default_: **0**)
  * `g:disableautotags`: **1** = Prevent tags from being automatically generated and highlighted | **0** = Automatically generate and highlight tags (_default_: **0**)
  * `g:disablelinebreaks`: **1** = Override filetype plugins so linebreaks never occur | **0** = Linebreaks are disabled by default, but filetype plugins can override this setting (_default_: **0**)
  * `g:powerlinefonts`: **1** = Render the statusline using characters available with powerline-patched fonts | **0** = Render the statusbar with less attractive but more compatible characters available in all fonts (_default_: **0**)
* **Custom Settings**: Settings with priority over those set by darkcloud-vimconfig can be added to a file named _vimrc.user_, located in _darkcloud-vimconfig/vim/_ or any of the folders in the runtimepath.
* **Custom Plugins**: Pathogen compatible plugins can be cloned or extracted to "darkcloud-vimconfig/vim/bundle.user/", or a folder named "bundle" or "bundle.user" in any of the folders in the runtimepath.
* **Custom Snippets**: To add or override Emmet snippets, create _~/.vim/snippets.json_ and add your own definitions using json like shown in the [Emmet Documentation](http://docs.emmet.io/customization/snippets/).
* **File Associations**: To use the file manager in vim to run files with external programs, create "~/.vim/filetypes.vim" and on each line, write an association between a file extension and the program to launch files of that type that looks like: `call vimfiler#set_execute_file('mp4','xdg-open')`.
* **Update Script**: (requires: bash+git) Use this to update the project and submodules, as well as handle any required maintenance, generate docs from the pathogen plugins and create missing config scripts with preset values.
* **Generate System Tags**: (requires: bash+ctags) Generate a list of ctags for your system libraries in _/usr/include_ and _/usr/local/include_ as well as any folders passed as arguments by running the _gentags_ script.
